### Tech

Slack Overflow uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport) - Passport is Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js.
* [Slack Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@slack/client) - Helps you build on all aspects of the Slack platform, from dropping notifications in channels to fully interactive bots.
* [Slack Events API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@slack/events-api) - This adapter enhances and simplifies Slack's Events API by incorporating useful best practices, patterns, and opportunities to abstract out common tasks.
* [Body Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) - Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.
* [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
* [jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom) - jsdom is a pure-JavaScript implementation of many web standards, notably the WHATWG DOM and HTML Standards, for use with Node.js. In general, the goal of the project is to emulate enough of a subset of a web browser to be useful for testing and scraping real-world web applications.
* [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) - Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript.
* [mySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) - mySQL is a node.js driver for mysql. It is written in JavaScript, does not require compiling, and is 100% MIT licensed.
* [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/?pdv=c&pcrid=232791429827&pmt=e&pkw=twilio&campaign=G_S_Brand_Alpha_NA&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=twilio&utm_campaign=G_S_Brand_Alpha_NA&utm_content=Brand&gclid=EAIaIQobChMItPOQxen-2gIVCsZkCh1SxQ_zEAAYASAAEgKF2_D_BwE) - Twilio allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls and send and receive text messages using its web service APIs. 
* [Parralax](https://materializecss.com/parallax.html) - Parallax is an effect where the background content or image in this case, is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling. Check out the demo to get a better idea of it.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Making the web more beautiful, fast, and open through great typography.
