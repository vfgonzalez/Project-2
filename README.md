### Tech
Slack Overflow uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [Passport] - Passport is Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js.
* [Slack Client] - Helps you build on all aspects of the Slack platform, from dropping notifications in channels to fully interactive bots.
* [Slack Events API] - This adapter enhances and simplifies Slack's Events API by incorporating useful best practices, patterns, and opportunities to abstract out common tasks.
* [Body Parser] - Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.
* [Express] - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.
* [jQuery] - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
* [jsdom] - jsdom is a pure-JavaScript implementation of many web standards, notably the WHATWG DOM and HTML Standards, for use with Node.js. In general, the goal of the project is to emulate enough of a subset of a web browser to be useful for testing and scraping real-world web applications.
* [Moment] - Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates and times in JavaScript.
* [mySQL] - mySQL is a node.js driver for mysql. It is written in JavaScript, does not require compiling, and is 100% MIT licensed.
* [Twilio] - Twilio allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls and send and receive text messages using its web service APIs. 
* [Parralax] - Parallax is an effect where the background content or image in this case, is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling. Check out the demo to get a better idea of it.
* [Google Fonts] - Making the web more beautiful, fast, and open through great typography.
